### Introduction 



The Hague, in Netherlands is one of the oldest cities in Netherlands and the government of Netherlands and its parliaments works from this city. Most parts of the current Hague was under sea few centuries ago and land was slowly reclaimed from the sea. Hague forms one of the three major cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Hague which form the Randstad region of Netherlands. Hague is on the west coast of Netherlands separated from the UK by the North Sea. Hague despite being an old city, is also very modern and multi-cultural with many international institutions and multi-national companies (see images). This mix of old and new urban developments give the city a good contrast amongst its neighborhoods .

### Problem Statement & Hypothesis



In this project, we will study and compare neighborhoods of Hague, The Netherlands. We will investigate if urban spread or sprawl over time, affects the composition of activities and texture of the urban fabric. For example, urban developments plans 30 years ago are not the same as now and will not be same 30 years later. The density of buildings, the landuse (mixed or segregated), composition of landuses depends on needs of the time. 



To understand more clearly, we wish to investigate if urban venues and their type, and their density differs over space and time.  Our hypothesis is yes, urban density, development  and land use depends on time, therefore the density of venues and type of venues we will be collecting from Foursquare should show this differences.



If our hypothesis is true, the clusters should show circular patterns as can be seen in the image below, which is an actual ground reality of 2021. This picture shows the color of buildings based on their age. The color range goes from hot-to-cold or red-to-blue. Red color shows the oldest part of the city while the blue color shows the new developments. Orange colors in between, are middle aged buildings.
